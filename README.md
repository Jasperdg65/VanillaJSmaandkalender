# VanillaJSmaandkalender
Created with CodeSandbox

Starting from code by Cre3z (https://codesandbox.io/s/03kl637k7n)

This is a simple Month calendar built with pure (Vanilla) JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
I have adjusted for the first weekday to be a monday (as we are used to in the Netherlands), did Dutch month translations and improved by removing borders from empty days.
